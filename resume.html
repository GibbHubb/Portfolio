        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>After graduating from the University of Queensland with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Sports and Exercise Science (Honours), I started full-time employment as the Head of Health and Wellbeing at Mycelium, a FinTech company. My responsibilities included ensuring the physical and mental fitness of all employees through biometric tracking, personalized training, and group sessions. Concurrently, I initiated a personal training sole proprietorship.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>In both roles, it was imperative to uphold client relationships, be well-mannered and respectful, and continuously communicate. I had to manage my time effectively, be very driven and results-oriented, as well as have a high level of technological skills.
