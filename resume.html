        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>After Graduating from the University of Queensland with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Sports and Exercise Science (Honours), I started full time employment as the Head of Health and Wellbeing at a FinTech company called Mycelium. My role was to ensure all the employees were fit for work both physically and mentally. It was here where my interest in software development was first sparked. Since then, following my passion,  I have begun my transition into computer science and software engineering. 
        I have now a complete understanding of CSS, HTML and Java and look forward to immersing myself in more back end development from here, while also still practicing my front ends skills</p>

        <h4>Experience Details</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Head of Health and Wellbeing at Mycelium, Brisbane City (Nov 2020 - Feb 2023)</li>

            <li>Teacher Assistant/Sport Coach, Copthorne Prep School, Copthorne (Jan 2016 - Dec 2016)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In both roles, it was imperative to uphold client relationships, be well-mannered and respectful, and continuously communicate. I had to manage my time effectively, be very driven and results-oriented, as well as have a high level of technological skills. Both roles made it imperative to be an independent worker but also work well with others both internal to the company and externally.</p>

        <p>I have recently moved to Europe with aims of furthering my experience and growing my career.</p>
